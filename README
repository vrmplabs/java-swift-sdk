2)  type "ant compile" (or "ant package" if you'd like the full package)

In order to run unit tests

1) Edit the file src/test/resource/cloudfiles.properties, changing the 
   username and password as needed
2) run "ant test" to run the unit tests
3) run "ant test-report" if you'd like to create a handy-dandy html report 
   on the tests.
